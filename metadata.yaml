description: Though we often associate stock exchanges with the hustle and bustle
  of the present-day financial services industry, the key structures underpinning
  these exchanges actually date back to ancient times, and the first modern example
  of a stock exchange was established in 1602. If you''re interested in eschewing
  trendy stock advice and sticking with the basics, Henry Voorce Brandenburg''s concise
  Profitable Stock Exchange Investments is a great place to start.
